# Social Sustainability â€“ ESG Data Storytelling Project

This project was developed as part of the **Data Storytelling and Visualization Lab**. It aims to assess the current state of **social sustainability** across Italy and continents through the lens of **ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance)** indicators.
We explored the data through multiple **visualization techniques**, focusing on identifying **trends, disparities, and patterns** in key social ESG indicators.
